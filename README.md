# Advent Of Code 2020

https://adventofcode.com/2020

Solutions can be ran via:

```
node dd/part-x
```

where dd is the 2 digit day and x is 1 or 2 for each part of the problem, e.g.:

```
node 01/part-1
node 02/part-2
```

Output will be generated in an `output-n.txt` file in the days directory. Input for each day is included in `input*.txt` files in the respective days directory, but is specific to my AoC login.
