Solutions can be ran via:

```
node yyyy/dd/part-x
```

where

- yyyy is the 4 digit year
- dd is the 2 digit day
- x is 1 or 2 for each part of the problem, e.g.:

```
node 2022/01/part-1
node 2020/02/part-2
```

Output will be generated in an `output-n.txt` file in the days directory. Input for each day is included in `input*.txt` files in the respective days directory, but is specific to my AoC login.
