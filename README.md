# Advent Of Code 2021

Solutions can be ran via:

```
node dd/part-x/index.js
```

where dd is the 2 digit day and x is 1 or 2 for each part of the problem, e.g.:

```
node 01/part-1/index.js
node 02/part-2/index.js
```

Output will be generated in an `output.txt` file in the directory of the executed `index.js`. Input for each day is included in `input.txt` files in the respective days directory, but is specific to my AoC login.
